# social_trip

Social Trip is an app made for people who wish to manage a group of travelers, or those who wish to participate in one.
Social Trip is meant to be simple and easy for use for everyone.

Social Trip was made as a final project of my computer science degree.

Front end was made with Flutter and Dart, using sdk ">=2.2.0 <3.0.0".
Back end was made with Firebase (User Authentication, Cloud Firestore).

The app can be compiled and run on iOS and Android devices (ran mine through Android Studio).
